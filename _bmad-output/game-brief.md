# Game Brief: Pay Up

**Date:** 2026-01-02
**Author:** Aloofbuddha
**Status:** Complete - Ready for GDD Development

---

## Executive Summary

Pay Up is a battle royale where buying cosmetics means negotiating with an AI that tracks its own API costs and will cut you off if you're wasting its time—making the economics of free-to-play gaming transparent and hilarious.

**Target Audience:** Casual PC/console gamers, specifically friends who are turned off by most battle royales due to skill gaps. Secondary audience: Streamers looking for shareable, absurd moments.

**Core Pillars:**

1. Transparency Without Shame - Show real costs openly and educationally
2. Playable First, Funny Second - Core BR gameplay must be fun before satire matters

**Key Differentiators:**

- AI-driven price negotiation with real-time token cost tracking
- Triple-layer cost transparency (player costs, item costs, AI costs)
- Casual-friendly battle royale (fun over balance)
- Satirical self-awareness throughout

**Platform:** PC (Steam/Itch.io) primary, console secondary consideration

**Success Vision:** Friends enjoy playing together, AI haggling creates shareable moments, and the game succeeds as a fun battle royale before the satire layer matters. If streamers pick it up, that's a bonus.

## Game Vision

### Core Concept

A battle royale where buying cosmetics means negotiating with an AI that tracks its own API costs and will cut you off if you're wasting its time—making the economics of free-to-play gaming transparent and hilarious.

### Elevator Pitch

A satirical battle royale that turns microtransactions into a negotiation game. Watch an AI bot argue with players about cosmetic prices while showing exactly how much their play session cost, how much the skin cost to make, and how much this conversation is costing in real-time API tokens. It's absurd, transparent, and designed to go viral.

### Vision Statement

Create shareable, absurd moments where players negotiate with an AI about cosmetic prices, making the hidden economics of gaming transparent and hilarious. Success means streamers can't help but clip the ridiculous haggling sessions—whether the bot accepts lowball offers, cuts players off for wasting tokens, or celebrates when someone pays full price. This game succeeds when players can't stop talking about the ridiculous economics.

---

## Target Market

### Primary Audience

Casual PC/console gamers, specifically friends who are turned off by most battle royales due to the skill gap between competitive and casual players. These players want a battle royale that's fun for casual gamers even if it's unbalanced—prioritizing enjoyment and friend-group play over competitive balance.

**Demographics:**

- Platform: PC and console gamers
- Experience level: Casual gamers
- Genre familiarity: Familiar with battle royales but turned off by their competitive nature
- Play patterns: Evening/weekend sessions with friend groups

**Gaming Preferences:**

- Prefer games that don't require extensive practice to enjoy
- Value social play with friends over competitive ranking
- Appreciate games with humor and self-awareness

**Motivations:**

- Want to experience battle royale gameplay without the pressure of skill gaps
- Looking for games that prioritize fun over competitive balance
- Enjoy satirical commentary and absurdist humor in games

### Secondary Audience

Streamers and content creators looking for shareable, absurd moments. The AI haggling system creates unique, clip-worthy content that streamers can't help but share—whether the bot accepts lowball offers, cuts players off for wasting tokens, or celebrates when someone pays full price.

### Market Context

**Similar Successful Games:**

- Indie satirical games (Getting Over It, The Stanley Parable) have proven there's an audience for absurdist commentary
- Battle royale genre is well-established with proven player base
- Games with unique hooks (Fall Guys, Among Us) show viral potential for novel mechanics

**Market Opportunity:**
This is a passion project designed primarily for friends to enjoy together. The market context supports viability: there's a gap for battle royales targeting casual friend groups with satirical elements. The timing is favorable—AI/LLM integration is accessible, and there's fatigue with predatory monetization models. While competing with established battle royales, the satirical angle and friend-group focus provide clear differentiation.

**Discoverability:**
Primary discoverability through word-of-mouth among friends. If streamers pick up the game and share the absurd AI haggling moments, that's a bonus for reach, but the primary goal is creating something fun for friends to play together.

## Game Fundamentals

### Core Gameplay Pillars

1. **Transparency Without Shame**

   - Show real operating costs openly and educationally
   - Display player session costs, item development costs, and AI token costs
   - No guilt-tripping or shaming free players
   - Information empowers player choice

2. **Playable First, Funny Second**
   - Core battle royale gameplay must be fun and functional
   - Satire enhances the experience but doesn't replace gameplay
   - Friends should want to play repeatedly for the BR mechanics alone
   - The game succeeds as a battle royale before the satire layer matters

**Pillar Priority:** When pillars conflict, prioritize "Playable First, Funny Second" - gameplay quality cannot be sacrificed for satire.

### Primary Mechanics

**Core Battle Royale (Apex Legends-inspired):**

- Drop into map, loot weapons/equipment, fight other players
- Shrinking play area forces encounters
- Last player/team standing wins
- Equal starts (same character, same starter gun) for fairness

**Unique Mechanics:**

- **Negotiate/Haggle:** Players negotiate cosmetic prices with an AI bot that tracks its own API costs
- **View Transparency:** Players see real-time operating costs (server, bandwidth, compute) and lifetime cumulative costs
- **Purchase Through Negotiation:** Buying cosmetics requires multi-turn negotiation where AI can accept, counter, or cut off unprofitable conversations

**Core Loop:** Drop → Loot → Fight → Survive → (Optional) Negotiate cosmetics → Repeat. The negotiation happens outside matches in the shop/menu.

### Player Experience Goals

**Primary Experience:**

- Fun, accessible battle royale gameplay that casual players can enjoy
- Absurd, shareable moments from AI haggling sessions
- Feeling of transparency and informed choice about game economics

**Emotional Journey:**

- **During Match:** Tension and excitement of BR gameplay, satisfaction of wins
- **In Shop:** Amusement and surprise from AI negotiation, curiosity about costs
- **After Session:** "That was fun" + "That negotiation was ridiculous" (shareable moment)
- **Overall:** Feeling that this game is honest and self-aware, unlike typical F2P games

**Success Metrics:**

- Players want to play another match (BR is fun)
- Players share clips of AI negotiations (absurd moments work)
- Friends recommend to other friends (social play succeeds)

   - Fun over balance - designed for friend groups, not ranked play
   - Equal starts reduce skill gap impact

4. **Satirical Self-Awareness**
   - Game acknowledges its own absurdity
   - Confirmation dialogs and season announcements are in on the joke
   - Commentary on games-as-a-service culture through gameplay

**Unique Value Proposition:**
A battle royale that's fun for casual players combined with satirical transparency about game economics, creating shareable moments through AI negotiation that no other game offers.

---

## Content Framework

### World and Setting

Minimal world-building - the game takes place in a generic battle royale arena. The setting is intentionally simple to keep focus on gameplay and satire. No deep lore needed - the "world" is the satirical commentary on game economics.

### Narrative Approach

**Minimal Narrative**

- No story-driven content
- Narrative exists only through satirical elements:
  - AI negotiation dialogue (self-aware, meta-commentary)
  - Season announcements (parody of live-service updates)
  - Cost transparency messages (educational, not narrative)
- Story emerges from player interactions with the AI haggling system

**Story Delivery:** Through gameplay systems (AI dialogue, UI messages, season announcements) rather than traditional narrative.

### Content Volume

**MVP Content:**

- Single BR map (small to medium size)
- Basic weapon set (2-3 weapons for MVP)
- Character model with color shader system (simple cosmetic implementation)
- AI negotiation system (core satire mechanic)
- Cost tracking UI (transparency layer)

**Post-MVP:**

- Additional maps (if game succeeds)
- More weapons (if needed)
- Seasonal color releases (one per season)

---

## Art and Audio Direction

### Visual Style

**Art Style:** Stylized 3D (Unreal Engine default/asset store acceptable)

- Simple, clean aesthetic
- Focus on functionality over visual polish for MVP
- Character models can be basic (color shader is the key cosmetic system)
- Map can use Unreal Engine templates or simple geometry

**Color Palette:** Bright, clear colors for visibility in BR gameplay. Default white character, seasonal colors (red, blue, green, etc.) are simple shader tints.

**References:** Apex Legends (gameplay feel), but simpler visually for MVP scope.

**Animation Complexity:** Minimal - basic character movement, shooting, looting. No complex animations needed for MVP.

### Audio Style

**Music:** Minimal or none for MVP. Can add later if needed.

**Sound Effects:** Basic BR audio (gunshots, footsteps, UI sounds). Can use Unreal Engine default sounds or asset store.

**Voice Acting:** None - all dialogue is text-based (AI negotiation is text, not voice).

### Production Approach

**In-House:** Programming, design, basic implementation
**Asset Store Acceptable:** Character models, weapons, map assets, sound effects
**Outsourcing:** None for MVP (keep scope minimal)
**AI Tools:** Acceptable for generating placeholder content if needed

## Risk Assessment

### Key Risks

1. **BR Networking Complexity (HIGH RISK)**

   - **Impact:** Core gameplay won't work
   - **Likelihood:** High - multiplayer BR is technically challenging
   - **Mitigation:** Start with smaller player count (10-20 players), use Unreal Engine networking templates, consider simplifying to smaller map

2. **AI API Costs (MEDIUM RISK)**

   - **Impact:** Ongoing operational costs could exceed revenue
   - **Likelihood:** Medium - depends on player engagement with haggling
   - **Mitigation:** Implement rate limiting, hybrid approach (templates + LLM), monitor costs closely, set budget caps

3. **Solo Development Scope (MEDIUM RISK)**

   - **Impact:** Project may take too long or never complete
   - **Likelihood:** Medium - BR is ambitious for solo dev
   - **Mitigation:** Strict MVP scope, "playable first" pillar - get BR working before satire layer, cut features if needed

4. **Discoverability (LOW-MEDIUM RISK)**
   - **Impact:** Game won't find audience
   - **Likelihood:** Medium - indie games struggle with visibility
   - **Mitigation:** Focus on friends first, streamer strategy is bonus not requirement, word-of-mouth primary

### Technical Challenges

- **Multiplayer Networking:** BR requires stable networking, matchmaking, replication. Use Unreal Engine's built-in systems, start simple.
- **AI Integration:** Claude API integration, token tracking, negotiation state management. Start with hybrid approach (templates + API).
- **Cost Tracking:** Real-time server cost calculation and display. May need estimation/approximation rather than exact costs.

### Market Risks

- **Saturated BR Market:** Many established competitors. Mitigation: Focus on casual friend groups, satirical angle differentiates.
- **AI Costs:** If haggling becomes popular, API costs could be high. Mitigation: Rate limiting, hybrid system, cost monitoring.

### Mitigation Strategies

**Primary Strategy:** MVP-first approach

- Get basic BR working (90% effort)
- Add satire layer only after BR is playable (10% effort)
- Cut features if scope becomes too large
- Friends-first audience reduces market pressure

**Technical Strategy:**

- Use Unreal Engine templates and asset store to reduce development time
- Start with smaller scale (fewer players, simpler map)
- Hybrid AI approach (templates for common cases, API for edge cases)

**Scope Strategy:**

- "Playable first, funny second" - gameplay quality cannot be sacrificed
- Minimal art/audio acceptable for MVP
- One map, few weapons, simple cosmetics for prototype
